Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Tony, I am currently a Comp Eng student at the University of Waterloo.

I am passionate about building interesting projects.

The current project I am working on is [Accountable](https://github.com/Accountable-learn). Accountable is a platform dedicated to facilitating English language learning.
My app caters to both schools in Asia and individual learners, offering a tailored approach to English learning. 

Accountable not only offers personalized learning solutions but also fosters vibrant learning communities.
Through features like progress tracking and friendly competition, users can engage with one another, enhancing their English language skills in an interactive and supportive environment.
The repo hasn't been updated on GitHub for a while as it was supposed to be my own startup but I lost the momentum due to some technical issues. 
Now, it is just a project I worked on occasionally on my local machine. I am trying out different solutions such as using a trained model to run speech-to-text recognition.
If you are interested in contributing to the project, you can email me at t3chan@uwaterloo.ca :)


Some other interesting projects,
In high school, I used Arduino to build a fully functional vending machine (yes, with casing, electronic components and everything).
It is more than a normal vending machine, it is an IoT vending machine! 
My idea is to connect the vending machine to the internet so users can check the stock remotely!
