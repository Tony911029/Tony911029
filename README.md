Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Tony, I am currently a Comp Eng student at the University of Waterloo.

I am passionate about building interesting projects.

One project I worked on is [Accountable](https://github.com/Accountable-learn). Accountable is a platform dedicated to facilitating English language learning.
My app caters to both schools in Asia and individual learners, offering a tailored approach to English learning.
